<h1> Why do we present data?</h1>

<p><font size=5>The purpose of putting results of experiments into graphs, charts and tables is two-fold. First, it is a visual
way to look at the data and see what happened and make interpretations. Second, it is usually the best way
to show the data to others. Reading lots of numbers in the text puts people to sleep and does little to convey
information. From an educational standpoint, students at most levels are required to learn various data
presentation methods, and learning to graph data one has collected oneself from one s own experiments is
considerably more engaging and motivating than learning to graph using data that is given by the teacher.</font></p>
